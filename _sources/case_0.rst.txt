A transfer function is ...


Problem Description
-------------------

A transfer function is somewhat like a filter that is applied to an incoming wave to produce an output signal. It determines how each frequency in the input motion is amplified or suppressed, by the medium of wave travel. Considering a spring-mass system with an excitation motion at input from the foundation connected to the spring and the corresponding response motion of the connected mass in the inertial system. The response motion of the mass will be a composite factor of the elastic and the viscous damping forces which are inherently embedded in the transfer function that determines the output motion we will obtain. In our wave propagation study we also employ transfer functions as a tool to explain the factors that make our input wave motion different from our output wave obtained. Evaluating the transfer function mathematically involves converting our known input motion to a Fourier series. Each term of the Fourier series is multiplied by the transfer function to obtain the Fourier series of the output response. Resonance is a physical phenomenon that occurs when the natural frequency of vibration of particles in a body (in our case the layers) matches the frequency of the forcing function (our input motion). It is experienced as an infinite amplification of the model.


Solution Strategy
-----------------

#. Open the Dr. Layer program. By default we get twelve layers. The top six layers are hardwired into the system with a velocity of specified as very fast. The bottom six layers are hardwired with a velocity of very slow.

#. Select all the layers to all have very slow values using the select all option.

#. On the top left hand corner of the menu box choose the plot box tool and apply a plot box at the top of the layers. Do the same at four arbitrary points along the soil layers. Note the height (:math:`H`) you place the plots.

#. Push the time increment button for about 1 minute.

#. Obtain the angular frequency :math:`(2p/T)`, where :math:`T` is the period i.e. time it takes to complete one revolution.

#. Obtain the maximum displacements from the plots by clicking on the crest of the curves with your cursor.

.. math::
    TF = \frac{1}{\cos(\frac{wH}{v_s})}

    AF = \frac{1}{|\cos(\frac{wH}{v_s})|}


Where

:math:`w` = Angular frequency (2pf)

:math:`H` = distance between any two points in the layers under consideration.

:math:`V` = Velocity of wave travel within the soil layer.

:math:`TF` = Transfer function

:math:`AF` = Amplification function


Dr. Layer's operation is controlled via menu commands (with associated keyboard accelerators), manipulation tools, scaling buttons, the load tool bar, and time control buttons. The program displays the results of its calculations visually in the form of animated displacements, and also in the form of dynamically generated time history plots. There are also mechanisms for getting numerical values.

SimCenter Tool Used

Time can be controlled using either the keyboard or the time control buttons:

* To run time **forward**: Press and hold the 'g' key or click and hold the time forward button: <insert icon>.

* To reset time to **zero**: Type the '0' key or click on the time reset button: <insert icon>.

* The current analysis time is **displayed** in the feedback pane at the bottom of the screen.

* The analysis time step size can be controlled via the Time Step menu (there are combinations of material properties and time steps that intentionally lead to unstable results, so beware).

* The display time step can be controlled via the Animation Speed menu. Internally, this command controls how many analysis time steps are computed between screen updates.


Example Application
-------------------

Dr. Layer's tool palette is illustrated below (Windows version: the Mac version is similar but grouped a bit differently):

<insert tool palette image>

* The **Arrow Tool** is used to select and manipulate objects.

* The **Panner** and **Camera Orbit Tools** are used to change the viewing point and camera orientation via clicking and dragging.

* The **Plot Box Tool** is used to create one of the various types of plot boxes: 

    * **Displacement Time History plots** are created by clicking on the relevant layer. The top node in the layer is used as the plotting target.

    * **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) plots** of a displacement history can be created by clicking on the time history plot.

    * **Stress-strain plots** can be created by control-clicking (i.e., holding down the control key while clicking) on the desired layer.


 These controls are self-explanatory in regards to their functions. Note the following, however:

.. note::
    The scaling buttons will continue to scale as long as they are held down. It is not necessary to click multiple times to get this effect.


Remarks
-------

* To adjust the **plotting scales**, use the small expansion/contraction triangular buttons on the plot for the horizontal scale, and the plot scale buttons on the `Scale Button Toolbar <#scaling-buttons>`_ for the vertical scale. 

.. note::
    You will notice that all plots scale together. This is so that plots of a given type can be compared visually without any misleading differences in scale factors.

* To adjust the **horizontal offset** of a plot, click in the plot and drag horizontally to scroll back and forth.

.. note::
    In general, plots will automatically scroll as necessary as time is running. Once you have manually scrolled a plot, though, the automatic scrolling will cease until time is reset to zero.

* Plot boxes can be added or removed at any time, but they only accumulate data beginning from the time they are installed, with the exception of FFT plots, which always plot the according to the data accumulated in the target time history. FFT plots can use up to the first 1024 points in a time history.


.. warning:: 
    Plotting FFT's will slow down the animation speed significantly, especially as the length of the time histories increase.
